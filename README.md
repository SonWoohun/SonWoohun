- 👋 Hi, I’m @SonWoohun
- 👀 I’m interested in history, economics, and psychology, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning economics. My master's degree paper was about the directional income mobility measurement which pertains to Frechet-Hoeffding bounds. Also, now I am studying about the construction of the Shinto shrines in rural societies of colonial Korea.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on economic historical subjects. I can help some parts in econometrics and Eastern Asian history.
- 📫 How to reach me ... call me through my email: sohnwh5991@gmail.com
